export const RANK_DESCRIPTIONS = {
  normal:
    "Normal rank: average lifespan for the race (about 60 years for humans). Some essence slots may be unused.",

  iron:
    "Iron rank: lifespan extends ~10+ years (~75). All four essence slots are filled, though awakening may be incomplete. Body begins converting toward a magic-based biomass. Sustenance: 1 Iron spirit coin/day, normal Iron-rank food, or double normal food. No bodily waste.",

  bronze:
    "Bronze rank: all abilities unlocked and advanced to Bronze [0]. Lifespan increases by decades over Iron (~100 years). Sustenance: 1 Bronze coin or 10 Iron coins/day, normal Bronze-rank food, or double Iron-rank food. No longer needs to breathe.",

  silver:
    "Silver rank: lifespan reaches ~200 years. Body is heavily enhanced by magic—rapid passive healing, supernatural senses, and new sensory capabilities. Many never advance past this rank. Sustenance: 1 Silver coin or 10 Bronze coins/day, normal Silver-rank food, or double Bronze-rank food. Gains limited levitation with concentration.",

  gold:
    "Gold rank: lifespan extends for centuries (~500 years). Body becomes more magical than biological; many functions like eating or breathing are optional. Advancement requires an essence revelation. Gold rankers often lead great houses. Sustenance: 1 Gold coin or 10 Silver coins/day, normal Gold-rank food, or double Silver-rank food. Unlocks access to the Will resource.",

  diamond:
    "Diamond rank: near-immortal. Body is almost entirely magical and can rebuild itself from near-death—or even death itself. Diamond rank represents mastery of both natural and supernatural laws. Sustenance: 1 Diamond coin or 10 Gold coins/day, normal Diamond-rank food, or double Gold-rank food."
